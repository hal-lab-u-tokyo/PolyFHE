          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the

          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 255 thread blocks.

          up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 21.2%. Try launching a grid with no

          can fit on the SM.

    OPT   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.
