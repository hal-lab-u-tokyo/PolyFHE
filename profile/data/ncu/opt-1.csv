          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 255 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 20.4%. Try launching a grid with no

          can fit on the SM.

    OPT   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.
